  <h3 class="alt-color">What are the complications of making a payment late or missing a payment altogether?</h3>

  <p>Payday advances should be used for short-term borrowing needs only, where you are able to payback the loan within 30 days or on your next pay day. We work with numerous lenders all of which have their own practices and distinct loan agreement terms and conditions. However, the consequences of non-payment can include:</p>

  <p> 1. Making it more difficult for you to obtain credit in the future or having to pay default charges to the lender. <br>
    2. Paying more for your credit by extending the term of the loan and therefore the period for which you pay interest. <br>
    3. Reports being made to a credit reference agency. </p>

  <p>So be sure to read carefully the terms outlined by the lender you have been matched with. If you are likely to miss or have any problems making a payment you should contact the lender directly.</p>
